**ORTHOPEDIC DASHBOARD**

Project Summary: Orthopedics Department Analytics Dashboard (2023)

**Overview:**

As part of my data analysis portfolio, I undertook a project to analyze patient data from the Orthopedic department of a healthcare facility. The goal was to derive actionable insights that could improve patient satisfaction and operational efficiency. The analysis culminated in the creation of a comprehensive, interactive Excel dashboard that allows stakeholders to explore the data and make informed decisions.

**Data Preparation and Transformation:**

**Data Filtering:**

I began by filtering the dataset to include only patients from the Orthopedic department. This ensured that the analysis was relevant and focused on the specific area of interest.

**Data Transformation:**

Date and Time Formatting: I standardized date and time formats to ensure consistency across the dataset, which was crucial for accurate analysis and visualization.
Age Binning: I grouped patient ages into bins (e.g., 1-10, 11-20, etc.) to simplify the analysis of age distribution and make it easier to identify trends across different age groups.

**Calculated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

I utilized Excel pivot tables to calculate essential KPIs such as the total number of patients, average patient satisfaction scores (PSAT), and average wait times. These KPIs provided a quick overview of the department’s performance and highlighted areas for potential improvement.

**Dashboard Design and Features:**

**Interactive Filters:**

Day of the Week and Month Filters: I implemented slicers that allow users to filter the data by specific days of the week or months. This interactive feature enables stakeholders to explore trends and insights for different time periods, offering a flexible analysis approach.

**Key Metrics Display:**

The dashboard prominently displays three key metrics—total number of patients, average PSAT score, and average wait time—at the top of the dashboard. This design choice ensures that the most critical information is immediately visible, providing a quick snapshot of departmental performance.

**Visualizations:**

**Monthly Patient Satisfaction:**
A table and bar chart visualize the average patient satisfaction scores and the number of patients for each month. This dual representation allows users to easily identify patterns and correlations between patient volumes and satisfaction levels.

**Age Distribution:**
A bar chart shows the distribution of patients across different age groups. This visualization helps in understanding the demographics of the patient population and can inform age-specific service improvements.

**Correlation Between Wait Time and Patient Volume:**

I created a combined bar and line chart to explore the relationship between hourly wait times and the number of patients. This visualization highlights periods of peak activity and potential bottlenecks, offering insights into operational efficiency.

Formatting and Technical Skills:

**Conditional Formatting:**

Applied conditional formatting to highlight critical data points, such as the highest and lowest patient satisfaction scores. This helped in quickly identifying areas of concern and success within the department.

**Custom Number Formatting:**

Implemented custom number formatting to standardize the display of percentages, times, and dates. This enhanced the readability and consistency of the dashboard, ensuring that users could easily interpret the data.

**Data Validation and Error Checking:**

Used data validation techniques to ensure that all data inputs were accurate and within expected ranges. This step was crucial in maintaining the integrity of the analysis and preventing errors in the final output.

**Advanced Excel Formulas:**

Leveraged advanced Excel functions such as SUMIF, AVERAGEIF, and INDEX MATCH to calculate various metrics and automate the data processing tasks. These functions were essential in deriving insights efficiently and accurately.

**Why These Choices Were Made:**

Focus on Usability: The choice of interactive filters and clear visualization was driven by the need to make the dashboard user-friendly and accessible to non-technical stakeholders. The goal was to allow users to explore the data without needing deep Excel knowledge.

Highlighting Key Insights: By placing KPIs at the top of the dashboard and using conditional formatting, I ensured that the most important information was immediately visible. This design choice helps in making data-driven decisions quickly and effectively.

Consistency and Clarity: Standardizing formats and implementing custom number formatting improved the overall clarity of the dashboard. Consistent data presentation reduces the cognitive load on users, allowing them to focus on insights rather than deciphering data formats.

**Insights from the Orthopedics Department Analytics **

1. Patient Satisfaction Trends:

Fluctuations Throughout the Year:
The average patient satisfaction score (PSAT) varied significantly across different months. The highest satisfaction was recorded in January (6.4) and August (6.1), while the lowest was in June (3.9). This suggests potential seasonal factors or operational changes that could be affecting patient experiences.

Potential Areas for Improvement:
The lower satisfaction scores in February, March, June, and September indicate periods where patient experience might have been suboptimal. Investigating the causes during these months could uncover opportunities for improving service quality or patient care processes.

2. Age Demographics:

Balanced Age Distribution:
The age distribution of patients is relatively even across most age groups, with the 51-60 years and 61-70 years age brackets having the highest patient counts. This indicates a broad demographic reach of the Orthopedic services, with no single age group dominating.

Targeted Interventions:
Given the higher patient volumes in the 51-60 and 61-70 age groups, targeted initiatives to improve patient care for these demographics could be particularly impactful in enhancing overall satisfaction.

3. Wait Time Analysis:

Correlation Between Wait Time and Patient Volume:
The analysis shows that patient volumes peak around 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM, with corresponding wait times of 38 and 33 minutes, respectively. However, the longest wait time (43 minutes) occurs at 11:00 PM, despite a lower patient volume (24 patients). This suggests potential inefficiencies or reduced staffing during late hours.

Operational Bottlenecks:
The longer wait times during late evening hours (10:00 PM - 11:00 PM) could indicate a need for better resource allocation or process improvements during these periods. Conversely, the consistent yet moderate wait times during peak hours suggest that the department is generally handling high volumes efficiently but might benefit from further optimization.

4. Monthly Patient Volume and Satisfaction Correlation:

No Direct Correlation:
Interestingly, the highest patient volumes do not necessarily correspond to the highest satisfaction scores. For example, July had one of the highest patient counts (55 patients) but a lower satisfaction score (4.7), while August, with a lower patient count (43), had one of the highest satisfaction scores (6.1). This suggests that factors other than patient volume, such as staff performance, patient care quality, or specific operational practices, may have a more significant impact on patient satisfaction.

5. Insights on Operational Efficiency:

Morning and Evening Operations:
The dashboard reveals that operations in the early morning (e.g., 5:00 AM) and late evening (e.g., 11:00 PM) may face challenges in maintaining low wait times despite lower patient volumes. This insight suggests that reviewing staffing levels and operational procedures during these hours could help in reducing wait times and improving patient satisfaction.
Steady Afternoon Performance:
Wait times and patient volumes during the afternoon (12:00 PM - 5:00 PM) are relatively stable, indicating efficient handling of patient flow during these hours. The department could analyze these time slots to replicate successful practices during less efficient hours.

6. Day of the Week Analysis (with slicer functionality):

Insight into Weekday vs. Weekend Performance:
By using the day-of-the-week slicer, stakeholders can analyze whether there are any significant differences in patient satisfaction, wait times, or volumes between weekdays and weekends. Early observations might suggest different trends or operational challenges on weekends that could be addressed with adjusted staffing or resource allocation.

**Conclusion:**

This project demonstrates my proficiency in data analysis, data visualization, and dashboard design using Excel. By transforming raw data into actionable insights and presenting them in a clear, interactive dashboard, I provided a powerful tool for healthcare management to monitor and improve the performance of the Orthopedic department. This dashboard is a testament to my ability to handle complex datasets, utilize advanced Excel features, and communicate insights effectively.
